When do you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
    When one wants to share/collaborate with others

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
    This might corrept the work in local computer, instead if one pulls manually, he will clearly know what changes were from local and what changes were from remote.
