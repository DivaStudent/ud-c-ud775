* When do you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
    + When one wants to share/collaborate with others

* Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
    + This might corrept the work in local computer, instead if one pulls manually, he will clearly know what changes were from local and what changes were from remote.

* Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
    + Clone: Copy entire repository. It could be between
        - local computer to local computer
        - local to remote (Though technically possible, But GitHub does not allow this)
        - remote to local
        - remote to remote
    
    + Fork: Fork is just a clone from a remote computer to another remote computer
        - GitHub does this on their servers
    
    + branches
        - branches are just named commits
        - commiting one branch is different from cloning the entire repository
